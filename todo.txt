-Decide what stats to generate for this geo and do it for a single year. Candidate topics:
    -Race, language spoken at home, ancestry, citizenship.
-Generate and graph the stats for 3 years (e.g. 2010, 2015, 2020).
-Redo this analysis as an aggregation of multiple "places". While there are only 4 "places" with 
"Great Neck" in their name, it really does look like the "missing places" are all there but under 
their own name (e.g. Kensington, Kings Point, Lake Success). CensusReporter does a good job of 
showing them in an interactive map: https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US3639309-kensington-ny/. 
This is likely a requirement for going further back in time, as I believe the School District geography
was only introduced in 2000.
-Can you get the data for the 2000 Decennial and compare it? This is available via the API. 
    -Did this geo even exist then?
-Can you get 1980 and 1990 from elsewhere? It is not available via the API. Perhaps via IPUMS?
